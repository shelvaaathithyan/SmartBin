Nowadays the major problem in India is cleanliness. If we are not maintaining the
cleanliness properly then disease will be spreaded. So that our Prime minister has introduced a
new scheme called as Swatch Bharat connecting to that scheme we have made a IOT based smart
bin for Smart city. The feature in this dust bin it can automatically open it cap by the help of ultra
sonic sensor, we have level indicator, if the dust bin is empty then the green light will glow if it
is filled with half than the yellow light will glow and the SMS will be sent to the municipal
corporation and they can collect the garbage, if the dust bin is filled fully then the red light will
glow an the cap will not open. In future we are going to add Solar panel for battery purpose ,
Crushing mechanism if we crush the dust then we will get more space , we are going to separate
bio-waste and non-bio waste , we are going to add an arm for dropping the waste in the
municipal lorry. We believe that our project will enhance the present waste management system.
